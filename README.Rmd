# acousticindices_vertebratediversity
Data and analysis scripts for paper looking at correlation between various acoustic indices and vertebrate diversity

Six different acoustic indices were used: ACI, ADI, AEI, BI, NDSI and EVN?

## To do
* 

# Table of Contents  
[Bootstrap correlations](#bootstrap-correlations)
| [Different ACI frequency bands](#different-aci-frequency-bands)
[Random forest models](#random-forest-models)
| [Bird diversity (morning, day, all)](#bird-diversity-vs-acoustic-indices-morning-day-all)

## Bootstrap correlations

### Different ACI frequency bands

## Random forest models

### Bird diversity vs acoustic indices (morning, day, all)
There was little difference in the predictive performance of random forest models on bird biodiversity when using acoustic indices calculated for all recordings, morning recordings (6am-9am), or day recordings (6am-6pm).
