# acousticindices_vertebratediversity
Data and analysis scripts for paper looking at correlation between various acoustic indices and vertebrate diversity

Six different acoustic indices were used: ACI, ADI, AEI, BI, NDSI and EVN?

## To do
* Rerun analyses with recleaned dataset (waiting on Seb and Don)
* Check whether I should be running glmer for some analyses - fitdistrplus (zero-inflated beta distribution for frogs?)

# Table of Contents  
[Species richness](#species-richness)  
[Shannon diversity index](#shannon-diversity-index)

### Bird diversity vs acoustic indices (morning, day, all)
There was little difference in the predictive performance of random forest models on bird biodiversity when using acoustic indices calculated for all recordings, morning recordings (6am-9am), or day recordings (6am-6pm).
